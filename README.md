# udacity_explore_bikeshare
- Explored data relating to Bike Share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington by writing code in R to import data.
- Compared the results of the data set between the three cities in regards to trip duration, average trip duration based on user type, the time of day when each trip begins and ends, and the most common start and end locations of each trip.
- Used the data provided to discover bike share usage patterns and answered questions about the data by writing code to compute descriptive statistics and make meaningful visualizations to compare the statistics of each city.
